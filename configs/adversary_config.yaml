# Notes:
# - Race + Hispanic are reported separately in Moss et al.; we approximate combined ethnicity
#   by scaling race proportions to (1 - Hispanic) and assigning Hispanic as its own category.
# - Age bins are approximated from decade bins using a uniform-within-bin assumption.
# - Some education subcategories are not reported; those are marked as slack.
